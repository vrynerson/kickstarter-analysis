# Kickstarting with Excel

## Overview of Project

### Purpose
To have a better understanding of raising money for a theater production, data was analyzed by comparing entertainment production fundraisers of all types. The productions were compared by gathering data on outcomes, country, time-frame, entertainment category, and financial goals. If the client follows the model of successful fundraisers, then they will have similar success with a fundraiser of their own.

## Analysis and Challenges


### Analysis of Theater Outcomes Based on Launch Date

In the Theater Outcomes Based on Launch Date chart (shown below), the number of theater production outcomes (i.e. success, fails, cancellations) was organized based on launch date. The total number of theater production campaigns came to 1369 with 839 successful, 493 failed and 37 cancellations.

I found there were a high number of successful theater fundraisers in May and June, making up 25% of the data within the successes. I also found the amount of failed productions ranged from 31 to 52 each month throughout the year, with May, July and October being the highest. This tells us the fundraising campaigns might have more success getting fully funded in the summer months.

### Analysis of Outcomes Based on Goals

The Outcomes Based on Goals chart (shown below) took the percentages of the successful, failed and canceled play fundraising goals and compared them to the monetary goal that was made for each play. Of the 1047 fundraisers done in the plays subcategory, there were no canceled plays. There were 694 successful campaigns and 353 failed campaigns. The data shows there is no explicit monetary goal amount that will determine the success of a plays' funding. An observation I found to be interesting was the lines on the chart are a mirror image of each other if the x-axis/central line is set at 50%.

### Challenges, Limitations, Other Charts
A challenge I encountered was not saving my pivot chart data after organizing and drawing conclusions, so I had to go through the process twice for the Outcomes Based on Goals data. A positive point was that it helped me gain more perspective on the data.

The limitations of the dataset include currency and time standardization. There are 12 different countries in this data set, which leads me to believe there are 12 different time zones and currencies. For transparency, the data used for launch date and monetary goals should have been standardized to the same time zones and currency.  

A bar chart could have worked to show the differences in each outcome category. A box and whiskers plot could have been a good option in tandem with the line chart to show the distribution of the data.
## Questions

- What are two conclusions you can draw about the Outcomes based on Launch Date?
- What can you conclude about the Outcomes based on Goals?
- What are some limitations of this dataset?
- What are some other possible tables and/or graphs that we could create?
